## This project uses the NYC flight dataset from problem set 4. 

It contains 3 pages:
    1. A brief summary page which calculates the total number of values in the dataset
    2. A plot page with a histogram of flights per month from the dataset. A widget in the sidebar allows users to isolate a specific origin airport to calculate the histogram values.
    A value under the table gives the total number of flights for all months, this value also changes when isolating a single origin airport.
    3. A table page where the data is displayed in table form, a slider on the left allows users to change how many rows are visible and a statistic above gives the average departure times (recalculated when changing the number of visible rows)
