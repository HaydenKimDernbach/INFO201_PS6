# INFO201_PS6

## This project uses the NYC flight dataset from problem set 4. 

It contains 3 pages:
1. A brief summary page which calculates the total number of values in the dataset

2. A plot page with a histogram of flights per month from the dataset. A widget in the sidebar allows users to isolate a specific origin airport to calculate the histogram values.
    This page also contains a widget to change the color of the histogram.
    A value under the table gives the total number of flights for all months, this value also changes when isolating a single origin airport.

3. A table page where the data is displayed in table form, a slider on the left allows users to change how many rows are visible and a statistic above gives the average departure times    
    (recalculated when changing the number of visible rows)
